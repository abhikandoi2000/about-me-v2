            Hey there, my name is Abhishek Kandoi. But my friends usually prefer calling me as kandoi. I see myself as a curious guy trying to learn more about history and computers. When I feel a bit odd I try to relax by listening to music and sometimes even dancing. Music squeezes all the worry out of me and I enjoy it a lot. Apart from all this I enjoy reading books concerning with history, inspiration, computers and fiction.  <br>
            <p class="interests">
              A lot changed after getting into IIT and my interests were no exception. I started enjoying a load of different activities which I didn't even try before IIT. This includes playing Guitar, writing and even playing with a Rubik's Cube.

              One thing that I enjoy the most is watching a horror movie with my friends. They really scare the hell out of me, and I scream at the top of my voice.
            </p>
            <p class="ambition">
              If there is one thing that I can be sure about in my life, it will be my desire to try different things and to explore the world. 
            </p>
            <p class="philosophy">
              What interests me is the way we share together and our willingness for the same.
              Well according to me.
              <blockquote>
                0pen is the new cool
              </blockquote>
              Sharing is of utmost importance for both self satisfaction and continous learning.<br>
              I believe with such an open mind, world can be transformed to a better place altogether.<br>
              Back in 2012 I created a list of 3 golden rules
              <blockquote>
                Closed is boring, open is cool.<br>
                Explicit is better than implicit<br>
                Practice makes perfect - old enough but true<br>
              </blockquote>
              Thought these rules might seem to be meant for coding, but they are general rules and thus can be followed by anyone interested and sharing a similar philosophy.

            <p class="born">
              I was born in a small town of Rajasthan. Soon after my birth I was moved to Kathmandu where I enjoyed the first 9 years of my life. Then after I came to Delhi only to get an admission in IIT Roorkee after my 9 years in Delhi.
            </p>
            <p class="childhood">
              I had a rather loveable childhood, maybe due to the fact that I am the youngest in my family.
              We used to play a lot of games in our free time, fully utilizing the hall meant for us.
              Almost everyday I used to eat a hell lot of a chocolates and got scolded less I would get my teeth damaged.
              <br />
              <br />
              While in UKG I was given an option to get promoted to 1st Class, which obviously I had not much idea about.
              It was my father who took this decision for me and I skipped UKG class.
              <br />

              My first official encounter with computers can be dated back to 2002 although I still have an email id
              abhikandoi2000@gmail.com.

            <p class="encounters">
              After my nine years of stay in Nepal, I moved to Delhi, again due to the same reason.
              <br/>
              This time it was different, my schooling till 3rd class was done in a Nepali medium school, after which I switched to a Hindi medium school so that I could easily get pickup my studies in New Delhi.
              <br />
              <br />
              It was here when I was fascinated by computers and started learning stuff that twisted the flow of my life.
              <br />
              There was this online game on www.pokemoncrater.com which me and my friend used to enjoy a lot. It was shutdown due to some personal problems of the admin.
              <br />
              <br />
              The idea to recreate it made me play around with HTML and PHP.
