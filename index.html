            My name is Abhishek Kandoi. <br>
            <p class="friends">
              My time spent with my friends is full of landmarks like that on an lively road.
              We eat together, we fight together, we GPLialize people together and try to make fun out of boring stuff. One such trial includes calling someone as foodu whenever he accomplishes a small task, clearly as an act of sarcasm.
            </p>
            <p class="interests">
              In my free time I like to play table tennis and if its summer holidays swimming is my best friend.
            </p>
            <p class="ambition">
              I am fascinated by the way computers work and I aspire to be a hacker. I wan't to know computers better than I my abc's, I am serious. Period.
            </p>
            <p class="philosophy">
              What interests me is the way we share together and our willingness for the same.
              Well according to me.
              <blockquote>
                0pen is the new cool
              </blockquote>
              Sharing is of utmost importance for both self satisfaction and continous learning.<br>
              I believe with such an open mind, world can be transformed to a better place altogether.<br>
              Back in 2012 I created a list of 3 golden rules
              <blockquote>
                Closed is boring, open is cool.<br>
                Explicit is better than implicit<br>
                Practice makes perfect - old enough but true<br>
              </blockquote>
              Thought these rules might seem to be meant for coding, but they are general rules and thus can be followed by anyone interested and sharing a similar philosophy.

            <p class="born">
              My birthplace is a small, almost town, village known as Rajgarh in the churu district of Rajasthan.
              After a few months of my birth I moved to Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal where my father moved a few months before my birth and has switched to confectionary business.
            </p>
            <p class="childhood">
              I had a rather loveable childhood, maybe due to the fact that I am the youngest in my family.
              We used to play a lot of games in our free time, fully utilizing the hall meant for us.
              Almost everyday I used to eat a hell lot of a chocolates and got scolded less I would get my teeth damaged.
              <br />
              <br />
              While in UKG I was given an option to get promoted to 1st Class, which obviously I had not much idea about.
              It was my father who took this decision for me and I skipped UKG class.
              <br />
              <br />
              My first official encounter with computers can be dated back to 2002 although I still had an email id
              abhikandoi2000@gmail.com.

              After my nine years of stay in Nepal, I moved to Delhi, again due to the same reason.
              <br/>
              This time it was different, my schooling till 3rd class was done in a Nepali medium school, after which I switched to a Hindi medium school so that I could easily get pickup my studies in New Delhi.
              <br />
              <br />
              It was here when I was fascinated by computers and started learning stuff that twisted the flow of my life.
              <br />
              There was this online game on www.pokemoncrater.com which me and my friend used to enjoy a lot. It was shutdown due to some personal problems of the admin.
              <br />
              <br />
              The idea to recreate it made me play around with HTML and PHP.
